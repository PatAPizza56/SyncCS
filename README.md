# SyncCS

## About

This library was created as an experiment of writing HTML using c#. It allows users to write c# code, which gets written to an html file. It supports CSS files for design as well! While creating SyncCS, I advanced my knowledge in the creation of librarys, as well as writing to files and appending to strings.
